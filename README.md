# MasteringGit
A reference to master github
this reference is split into 12 chapters.

Chapter 1, Git Basics in Practice, serves as a reminder of version control basics with
Git. The focus will be on providing the practical aspects of the technology, showing
and explaining basic version control operations for the development of an example
project, and the collaboration between two developers.
Chapter 2, Exploring Project History, introduces the concept of the Directed Acyclic
Graph (DAG) of revisions and explains how this concept relates to the ideas of
branches, tags, and the current branch in Git. You will learn how to select, filter,
and view the range of revisions in the history of a project, and how to find revisions
using different criteria.


Chapter 3, Developing with Git, describes how to create such history and how to add
to it. You will learn how to create new revisions and new lines of development.
This chapter introduces the concept of the staging area for commits (the index), and
explains how to view and read differences between the working directory, the index,
and the current revision.


Chapter 4, Managing Your Worktree, focuses on explaining how to manage the
working directory (the worktree) to prepare contents for a new commit. This chapter
will teach the reader how to manage their files in detail. It will also show how to
manage files that require special handling, introducing the concepts of ignored files
and file attributes.


Chapter 5, Collaborative Development with Git, presents a bird's eye view of the various
ways to collaborate, showing different centralized and distributed workflows. It will
focus on the repository-level interactions in collaborative development. You will
also learn here the concept of the chain of trust, and how to use signed tags, signed
merges, and signed commits.


Chapter 6, Advanced Branching Techniques, goes deeper into the details of collaboration
in a distributed development. It explores the relations between local branches and
branches in remote repositories, and describes how to synchronize branches and
tags. You will learn here branching techniques, getting to know various ways of
utilizing different types of branches for distinct purposes (including topic branch
workflow).


Chapter 7, Merging Changes Together, teaches you how to merge together changes
from different parallel lines of development (that is, branches) using merge and
rebase. This chapter will also explain the different types of merge conflicts, how to
examine them, and how to resolve them. You will learn how to copy changes with
cherry-pick, and how to apply a single patch and a patch series.


Chapter 8, Keeping History Clean, explains why one might want to keep clean
history, when it can and should be done, and how it can be done. Here you will
find step-by-step instructions on how to reorder, squash, and split commits. This
chapter also demonstrates how can one recover from a history rewrite, and explains
what to do if one cannot rewrite history: how to revert the effect of commit, how to
add a note to it, and how to change the view of project's history.


Chapter 9, Managing Subprojects â€“ Building a Living Framework, explains and shows
different ways to connect different projects in the one single repository of the
framework project, from the strong inclusion by embedding the code of one
project in the other (subtrees), to the light connection between projects by nesting
repositories (submodules). This chapter also presents various solutions to the
problem of large repositories and of large files.


Chapter 10, Customizing and Extending Git, covers configuring and extending Git to
fit one's needs. You will find here details on how to set up command line for easier
use, and a short introduction to graphical interfaces. This chapter explains how to
automate Git with hooks (focusing on client-side hooks), for example, how to make
Git check whether the commit being created passes specified coding guidelines.


Chapter 11, Git Administration, is intended to help readers who are in a situation of
having to take up the administrative side of Git. It briefly touches the topic of serving
Git repositories. Here you will learn how to use server-side hooks for logging, access
control, enforcing development policy, and other purposes.


Chapter 12, Git Best Practices, presents a collection of version control generic and
Git-specific recommendations and best practice. Those cover issues of managing
the working directory, creating commits and a series of commits (pull requests),
submitting changes for inclusion, and the peer review of changes.
